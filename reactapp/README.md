## API Integration

The application communicates with the Spring Boot backend through the `api.js` service layer:

- **GET /api/surveys/all** - Retrieve all surveys
- **POST /api/surveys/create** - Create new survey
- **DELETE /api/surveys/{id}** - Delete survey
- **GET /api/surveys/{id}** - Get survey by ID
- **PUT /api/surveys/{id}** - Update survey ID

## Key Features

### Survey Creation (CreateSurvey.js)
- Simple form with title input and dynamic question addition
- Real-time validation and error handling
- Success/error notifications
- Form reset after successful submission
- Navigation to survey list after creation

### Survey Listing (SurveyList.js)
- Displays all surveys from backend API
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state when no surveys exist
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Responsive grid layout

### Navigation (Layout.js)
- Sidebar navigation with clear options
- Active state indication
- Responsive design
- User-friendly interface

## Validation Rules (SRS Appendix D)

| Field | Validation Rules | Error Messages |
